        <h2>History and Ideology</h2>
        <p>The Taliban is an Islamist militant group that originated in Afghanistan during the early 1990s, emerging from the chaos following the Soviet-Afghan War. Rooted in a strict interpretation of Deobandi Islam, they seek to establish a government based on their version of Sharia law. Known for their harsh policies, the Taliban gained control of much of Afghanistan by 1996, imposing severe restrictions on women’s rights, education, and personal freedoms. After being ousted in 2001 by a U.S.-led coalition, they regrouped and regained power in August 2021 following the withdrawal of foreign troops. Key aspects to understand about them include their reliance on guerrilla warfare, their complex relationship with al-Qaeda, and their ongoing impact on Afghan society, including limited access to education and healthcare, especially for women and girls.</p>
        <h2>Social Relevance</h2>
        <p>The Taliban’s return to power is highly socially relevant as it continues to shape global discussions on security, human rights, and international diplomacy. Millions of Afghans face humanitarian crises, with limited access to food, healthcare, and education, while women’s rights are being severely restricted once again (United Nations, 2023). Moreover, the Taliban’s rule affects regional stability and influences global counterterrorism strategies. By creating a website about this topic, the project will contribute to raising awareness of the ongoing consequences of conflict and governance in Afghanistan.</p>
