        <p>This project will examine the Taliban, an Islamist militant group that has played a central role in Afghanistan’s modern history. Emerging in the 1990s, the Taliban first rose to power in 1996, enforcing strict interpretations of Islamic law and limiting freedoms, especially for women (BBC News, 2021). Following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001, the Taliban was ousted but gradually regained strength, leading to their return to power in August 2021 after the withdrawal of foreign troops (Al Jazeera, 2021). Their resurgence has drastically changed Afghanistan’s political, social, and economic landscape.</p>
